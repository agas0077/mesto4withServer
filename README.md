# mesto4withServer
Hi, my name is Andrey and this is my first project on GH. Now, is has become a repository just for server for my project mesto4 (check in my repos). 

### How to use
To user this server, use _npm run start_

### Version 
The current version is __0.3.1__

### Techs
In this project I used such technologies as Node.js, Express, EsLint, Body-Parser, MongoBD, Mongoose etc. For all techs used in the project check package.json .

### Current state
I hope it has now become a fully functional server...
